    excerpt: "Discover how we preserve our cultural heritage while embracing contemporary values in today's fast-paced world.",
    content: `<p>In the Khanal family, tradition is not something we store away in dusty shelves—it lives, breathes, and evolves with us. From performing morning pujas to celebrating festivals like Dashain and Tihar, our days are grounded in the rituals passed down through generations. Yet, we are also part of a rapidly changing world, filled with smartphones, global careers, and digital realities. Rather than resist change, we’ve chosen to integrate it into our traditions.</p>
  
  <p>Each Dashain, even those living abroad gather virtually—wearing tika and jamara together through video calls. We preserve family bonding with weekly Zoom “satsangs,” where elders recite stories of ancestors, and cousins across continents listen with awe.</p>
  
  <p>Our kitchen is both sacred and smart. While incense and mantra echo in one corner, another glows with the screen of a tablet guiding a modern take on a traditional recipe. We log family events in shared Google Calendars, yet pause for collective aartis without fail.</p>
  
  <p>These adaptations aren’t compromises—they are creative continuations. Our traditions are stronger not in their rigidity, but in their flexibility. In the Khanal Pariwar, the past and future walk hand-in-hand.</p>`,

  excerpt: "Exploring the flavors of our heritage through family recipes passed down for generations.",
  content: `<p>In the Khanal kitchen, cooking is more than nourishment—it is performance, prayer, and storytelling in one. Our food is a love letter to the generations before us, written in spice and smoke.</p>

<p>Every Saturday, the family gathers around the chopping board. The air fills with the aroma of cumin, garlic, and cardamom as our elders recount stories of how these recipes came to be. Momos are not just dumplings—they’re memories. Each fold holds a story: of the time Didi cried laughing over her first failed attempt, of how Aama taught us the perfect meat-to-dough ratio, and of late-night feasts during monsoon season.</p>

<p>We are preserving these recipes through a digital family cookbook, complete with voice notes, scanned handwritten pages, and video tutorials. Our grandmother’s legendary achaar blend is now documented with timestamps and love.</p>

<p>Nepali cuisine teaches patience. You can't rush perfect sel roti. But as we fry them in cast iron pans, we stream family music playlists and discuss coding problems or global politics. Tradition simmers alongside progress in every pot.</p>`,

  excerpt: "How our family keeps the spirit of Dashain alive, even when miles apart.",
  content: `<p>Dashain in the Khanal Pariwar is not confined by geography. Though some of us now live in the UK, US, Australia, or Dubai—when Dashain arrives, we are together.</p>

<p>Preparations begin weeks in advance. Tika envelopes are prepared, jamara is couriered with urgency and care, and virtual call schedules are posted in family WhatsApp groups. Laptops are transformed into mandirs. On the day of tika, screens glow with saffron blessings, and chins are lifted reverently across continents.</p>

<p>Our Dashain rituals now include digital pujas streamed from Kathmandu, virtual potluck dinners, and collaborative playlists of Bhajans and old family favorites. Children, born abroad, ask about Devi Durga, and learn to say "Aashirbaad" to virtual elders with folded hands.</p>

<p>We even organize cross-country Dashain competitions—best homemade sel roti, most creative jamara photo, and storytelling nights where teens recite tales of Mahishasura’s defeat.</p>

<p>Distance no longer means disconnection. In fact, these adaptations have strengthened the festival’s core values: unity, reverence, and renewal.</p>`,

    excerpt: "Teaching the next generation about respect, family, and cultural pride in a modern world.",
    content: `<p>Parenting today is a balancing act—especially when raising children with roots in Nepal and wings around the world. In the Khanal household, we’ve made it a mission to raise global citizens who never forget the soil they came from.</p>
  
  <p>From the first word, our kids are taught not just “Hello,” but “Namaste.” At bedtime, Harry Potter shares the shelf with tales of Gautam Buddha and Bhanu Bhakta. Our children learn about artificial intelligence by day and light butter lamps by evening.</p>
  
  <p>We host family values workshops, storytelling circles, and teach them how to give daan during Makar Sankranti. Respect for elders isn’t just demanded—it’s demonstrated. Children witness grandparents being taken care of, their stories being listened to with patience.</p>
  
  <p>Our philosophy is simple: let children explore the world, but give them strong roots to hold onto when the winds get strong. Teach them coding, but also compassion. Let them dream of Mars, while still knowing the mythology of Mount Meru.</p>`,

      excerpt: "Using technology to document and share our ancestral stories for future generations.",
      content: `<p>History lives in the Khanal home—not as a subject, but as a shared identity. Great-grandfather Bishnu Prasad’s journey from the hills of Palpa to the valley of Kathmandu isn’t just a story, it’s a legacy we honor and preserve.</p>
    
    <p>We’ve taken to technology to immortalize this history. Old family albums are scanned, labeled, and uploaded into a shared family drive. Oral histories, recorded in crackling yet sincere voices of our elders, are edited into a podcast-style archive called “Khanal Gatha.”</p>
    
    <p>Each relative has a digital profile page with life milestones, photos, quotes, and their contribution to the family’s journey. Children interview elders, asking questions that reveal lessons no textbook can teach.</p>
    
    <p>We use Notion to create an interactive Khanal timeline—from the first land plot we bought in Kathmandu to the latest cousin graduating abroad. These records are backed up to the cloud, ensuring that decades from now, the next generation won’t have to guess who we were. They’ll know.</p>
    
    <p>Our past isn’t a fading photograph—it’s a living, searchable, emotional encyclopedia.</p>`,
